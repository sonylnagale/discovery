# Discovery Code Challenge

Sonyl Nagale : <sonyl@nagale.com>

## Installation

Install dependencies with `yarn`. If you need yarn, take a peek [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

## Running

Begin the server with `yarn start`. The desktop browser will launch the UI.

## Testing

Tests were created using Puppeteer and can be run with `npm test`.

## Notes

I implemented desktop and most of tablet, to the point where I believe I've shown how to use breakpoints, but I did not complete the responsive CSS in lieu of spending time on testing and linting.

Regarding linting, I used an opinionated set from AirBnB that a colleague of mine provided to me a while back. I did not spend _too_ much time resolving all of the linted errors, but to my knowledge, for the most part this React code adheres to latest best practices.
